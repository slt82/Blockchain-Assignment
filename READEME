Final Project README


This project is composed of two applications, a client and a server.

The server is composed of:
  BlockChain.kt (the kotlin file that makes up most of the data classes for the back end)
  JavaServer.java (the java file that handles client connections)
  Admin.java (the java class that works in unison with the server class)
  
The client is composed of:
  JavaClient.java (the java class that allows a client to communicate with the server)
  
I have included the gradle.build files for the server and client applications that I used to 
build the applications and create jar files with. The client can be built as a regular java project
but the server has to be a project that targets Kotlin JVM, as reflected in the build file. I used
Intellij and its Kotlin plugin, and built both applications as gradle projects.

The simplest method for running the applications is to pull the jar files and run them in the command line:

java -jar PATH/Server.jar
java -jar PATH/Client.jar

The server must be spun up before any clients are.
